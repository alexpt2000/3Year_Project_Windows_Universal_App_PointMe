## PointMe
This application allows the user to save their favorite points, and also displays the current location, also showing the distance between your location and the points that are on your favorites list.


## How it works?
The user must first accept that the device obtains its location.

Clicking on the point chosen by the user on the map will show a dialog box in which the user can then enter the name of the point and also some additional information.
